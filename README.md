# CloseTheGapSocial

turning theoretical programming knowledge into practical projects. In Close the Gap - Social these projects will mainly be about social Networks.

Planned topics are among others:

- Instagram Uploader (automatically upload Pictures to Instagram)
- YouTube View Manipulator (manipulate the YouTube View Counter)
- Facebook Comment Bot (share your views across multiple groups)
- Twitter Follow/Unfollow (increase your follower numbers)
- GitHub Green Streakr (keep your activity stream green, even when your not doing anything at all)
- Further projects can be added, the final e-book should contain about 10 projects

Suggestions for further projects are welcome, these should be realizable in about 100-200 lines of code. Each project starts with a basic version that contains the absolute minimum functionality to show the feasibility of the solution. In 3 -4 further steps the basic solution is then improved and additional functionality is added.

The E-Book should be available free of charge. If you want to participate in the project, please contact me :)
